# The Alarm(Dun Dun Dun)
The most sinister of archenimies
The primordial villain in our pursuit of long and enjoyable rest, a constant reminder of the responsibilities thrust unto us unjustly (by our own design), the alarm is a massive pain that most times dose not even work to properly wake up or senses, leaving us to trudge around drowsily till we face enough adversity to really get us going. 

## Wakeerr 
So what can we do different you might wonder, well apart from the cool (weird) name, we at wakeer believe we have a way to make sure your alarm gets you up and ready for the day. 
Through engaging our users in mentally stimulating activities we believe we can make alarms more effective. 

## Mentally Stimulating Activities
Trivia, all that was a fancy word for trivia, we believe that engaging in challenges relating to subjects of interest of our users will help in getting the brain and body set to take on the challenges of the day.
